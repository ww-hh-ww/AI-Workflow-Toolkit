# AIWF System Guide

AIWF is the governance layer for this project. It tracks what phase you're in, what files you can write, what evidence you need, and what gates must pass before work is considered done. You don't need to memorize the rules — the state machine tells you what to do next.

## Your first action every session

```
aiwf status
```

Run this. Always. The output tells you exactly what to do:

- **PRIMARY** — your current task. Do this.
- **REQUIRED NEXT** — blocked until you complete this step. Each blocker includes the exact `fix:` command.
- **[ATTN]** — which skill to load for this phase.
- **Recovery** — if something is wrong (fix_loop, scope_violation, plan_only_drift), this section explains the problem and legal options.

**Obey PRIMARY and REQUIRED NEXT.** If your intended action conflicts with status, stop and explain.

## Decision tree

```
aiwf status
│
├─ PRIMARY says "discuss/plan" 
│   → Load /aiwf-planner
│   → Shape the Goal Tree (aiwf goal-tree ...)
│   → Create Plan (aiwf plan create ...)
│   → Freeze contracts (/aiwf-planner-contracts)
│   → aiwf plan activate <PLAN-ID>
│
├─ PRIMARY says "activate a task"
│   → Confirm the Plan has allowed_write, forbidden_write, and purpose
│   → aiwf task plan <ID> --plan <PLAN-ID> --title '...'
│   → aiwf task activate <ID>
│   → If blocked by phase gate: read the blocker message, run the fix command
│
├─ PRIMARY says "implement"
│   → Load /aiwf-planner-execute + /aiwf-implement
│   → Write code within allowed_write
│   → Record evidence: aiwf state record-role-evidence --role executor --scan-git
│
├─ PRIMARY says "test"
│   → Load /aiwf-test
│   → Evidence must exist before testing (implementing→testing gate)
│   → Run tests, record: aiwf state record-testing --status adequate ...
│
├─ PRIMARY says "review"
│   → Load /aiwf-review
│   → Testing must be adequate, cleanup verified (testing→reviewing gate)
│   → aiwf cleanup check && aiwf state mark-cleanup-fresh
│   → Review, record: aiwf state record-review --verdict PASS ...
│
├─ PRIMARY says "close"
│   → Load /aiwf-close
│   → aiwf state prepare-close
│   → If passed=False: read blockers, fix them, re-run
│   → If passed=True: aiwf task close <TASK-ID>
│
├─ Recovery: plan_only_drift
│   → Plan exists but no task. Edit the Plan artifact to fill required fields (Impact, scope),
│     then aiwf task plan ... && aiwf task activate ...
│     Plan files (.aiwf/artifacts/plans/) are editable during drift.
│
├─ Recovery: fix_loop
│   → Fix the listed required_fixes, verify with required_verification,
│     then aiwf fixloop resolve --resolution '...'
│
├─ Recovery: scope_violation
│   → Revert the violating files (git confirms), then
│     aiwf fixloop resolve --resolution '...'
│
└─ [ATTN] tells you which skill to load. Load it.
```

## Key CLI commands

### Navigation
```
aiwf status                    — what phase am I in? what must I do next?
aiwf status --debug            — full state dump
```

### Goal Tree (structure)
```
aiwf goal-tree show            — see the whole tree
aiwf goal-tree init-root <ID> --type main --title '...'
aiwf goal-tree add <ID> --parent <PARENT-ID>
aiwf goal-tree graft <ID> --target <PARENT> --interface-consumed '...' --capability-provided '...'
aiwf goal-tree prune <ID> --reason '...'
aiwf goal-tree validate        — check tree integrity (cycles, orphans)
```

### Goal relations (capability graph)
```
# Provider → consumer; advisory support, not an execution gate
aiwf relation add GOAL-EVIDENCE-GRADING GOAL-QUERY-STRATEGY supports \
  --cross --reason 'query strategy consumes graded evidence'

# Consumer → prerequisite; functional dependency, still advisory for execution
aiwf relation add GOAL-ANALYSIS-FRAMEWORK GOAL-SEARCH-STRATEGY depends_on \
  --cross --reason 'analysis consumes search strategy output'

aiwf relation show GOAL-ANALYSIS-FRAMEWORK
```

Tree parent/child means capability containment. Goal relations mean cross-Goal
consumption, support, conflict, or dependency. A horizontal capability can stay
as a sibling Goal and support several consumers. If execution order must be
enforced, create a Plan dependency separately.

### Mission (why)
```
aiwf mission show
aiwf mission update --statement '...' --boundary '...' --status active
```

### Plan (how)
```
aiwf plan create <PLAN-ID> --goal-id <GOAL-ID> --kind implementation --work-intent feature \
  --allowed-write 'src/...' --purpose '...'
aiwf plan activate <PLAN-ID>   — explicitly choose which Plan is active (NOT automatic)
aiwf plan deactivate            — clear active plan, return to discussing
aiwf plan update --task-id <ID> --section impact --content "..."
```

### Task (execution unit)
```
aiwf task plan <TASK-ID> --plan <PLAN-ID> --title '...'
aiwf task activate <TASK-ID>
aiwf task close <TASK-ID>      — only after prepare-close passes
```

### Scope (boundaries live on the Plan)
```
aiwf plan create PLAN-001 --goal-id GOAL-001 --allowed-write 'src/...' --purpose '...'
```

### Quality gates
```
aiwf state record-quality-brief --acceptance-criterion '...' --non-goal '...'
aiwf state record-testing --status adequate --supports-plan <ID> --supports-goal <ID>
aiwf state record-review --verdict PASS --accepted-evidence-id <ID>
aiwf state prepare-close       — authoritative: tests passed? review accepted? cleanup fresh?
```

### Fix-loops & recovery
```
aiwf fixloop resolve --resolution '...'
aiwf state cancel-close        — recover from stuck closing state
```

### Milestones (delivery checkpoints)
```
aiwf milestone create <ID> --mission-id MISSION-001 --covered-goal <GOAL-ID>
aiwf milestone assess <ID> --verdict PASS --summary '...'
aiwf milestone close <ID>
```

## The structural model

```
Mission ("why this project exists")
├── Goal Tree ("complete capability structure — recursive Goals")
│    └── Plan ("procedural scaffold — how to achieve a Goal")
│         └── Task ("execution unit")
└── Milestones ("horizontal delivery slices referencing covered Goals")
```

- **Mission**: semantic anchor, no hard gates. Defines statement + boundaries. Injected into Context on start.
- **Goal**: first-class product/system capability, including capabilities that existed before AIWF was installed. Can be grafted, pruned, nested. The tree's operation unit.
- **Milestone**: independent horizontal delivery checkpoint. Has a mechanical verdict gate (PASS/PASS_WITH_RISK/REVISE/REJECT). It references specific Goals through `covered_goal_ids`; it does not own the Goal Tree or define Goal boundaries.
- **Plan**: how a Goal is achieved. Has `plan_kind`, `work_intent`, `interfaces`, `constraints`. Must be explicitly activated.
- **Task**: execution unit. Inherits scope from its Plan and moves through the state machine.

Goal Tree rules:

- Model the complete capability structure, not only the next milestone or the
  work that remains.
- Inventory existing behavior and represent already-delivered capabilities as
  Goals before adding new capability branches.
- Do not use file paths, directory names, implementation phases, or milestone
  slices as Goal identities.
- Put paths in `module_boundaries`, Plan scope, interfaces, and Context instead.
- Record durable Goal-to-code ownership with
  `aiwf project-map bind <GOAL-ID> --module <PATH> [--entrypoint <PATH>]`.
- Run `aiwf project-map validate` after Goal Tree or module-boundary changes.
- `goals.json` owns capability identity; `.aiwf/assets/project-map.json`
  `goal_bindings` owns curated capability-to-module mapping.

## Phase gates

Every phase transition checks that required fields are filled. Blockers have this format:

```
[field_name] What is missing? — fix: aiwf command ...
```

**Do not hand-edit JSON. Run the fix command.**

Common blockers and fixes:

| Blocker | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `plan.plan_kind` empty | `aiwf plan update --task-id <ID> --section goal --content 'plan_kind: implementation'` |
| `plan.work_intent` empty | `aiwf plan update --task-id <ID> --section goal --content 'work_intent: feature'` |
| `plan.target_goal_id` empty or missing | `aiwf plan create PLAN-ID --target-goal <GOAL-ID>` |
| `plan.allowed_write` empty | `aiwf plan create PLAN-ID --allowed-write 'src/path/' --goal-id GOAL-001` |
| `plan.purpose` empty | `aiwf plan update --plan-id PLAN-ID --section goal --content '...'` |
| `contract.non_goals` empty | `aiwf state record-quality-brief --non-goal '...'` |
| `contract.acceptance_criteria` empty | `aiwf state record-quality-brief --acceptance-criterion '...'` |
| `evidence` no records | `aiwf state record-role-evidence --role executor --summary '...' --scan-git` |
| `testing.status` not adequate | Run tests, then `aiwf state record-testing --status adequate ...` |
| `cleanup` not verified | `aiwf cleanup check && aiwf state mark-cleanup-fresh` |
| `review.verdict` pending | `aiwf state record-review --verdict PASS ...` |
| `goal.graft_interface` missing (L2+) | `aiwf goal-tree graft <ID> --target <PARENT> --interface-consumed '...' --capability-provided '...'` |
| `relation.reason` missing (L2+) | `aiwf relation add <A> <B> <TYPE> --cross --reason '...'` |

## Mechanical truth

These files must change through `aiwf` CLI commands, never direct Write/Edit/Bash:

- `.aiwf/state/state.json` `.aiwf/state/goal.json` `.aiwf/state/contexts.json` `.aiwf/state/fix-loop.json`
- `.aiwf/state/goals.json` `.aiwf/state/plans.json` `.aiwf/state/milestones.json`
- `.aiwf/artifacts/quality/testing.json` `.aiwf/artifacts/quality/review.json`
- `.aiwf/runtime/history/task-ledger.json`

The Write Guard blocks Write/Edit to these. The Bash Guard blocks Bash commands referencing `.aiwf/state/` or `.aiwf/artifacts/quality/`. If blocked, the error message includes the fix command.

## Workflow levels (L0–L3)

| Level | When | Team |
|-------|------|------|
| L0 | typo, label, simple script | Planner inline, self-review |
| L1 | small feature, 1-2 files | single agent + light review |
| L2 | API, multi-module, refactor | independent Tester + Reviewer |
| L3 | security, migration, destructive | full team + checkpoint + user decision |

Task activation computes the level mechanically from file breadth, cross-module scope, fix-loop history, and risk flags.

## Work intent discipline

Every Plan must declare a `work_intent`. It governs what the Executor may and may not do:

| Intent | Allowed | Forbidden |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `feature` | implement capability, document interfaces | refactor unrelated code |
| `bugfix` | minimal fix, root cause, regression test | new features, API changes |
| `refactor` | restructure internals, preserve behavior | new features, API changes |
| `cleanup` | remove dead code | delete machine truth, change semantics |
| `migration` | preserve data, fallback path | delete old path, break compatibility |
| `verification` | focus on evidence | change implementation |
| `exploration` | isolate, record findings | commit to stable structure |
| `documentation` | match current behavior | change machine semantics |
| `integration` | integrate branches, check convergence | change interfaces |
| `release` | release hygiene, audit | change behavior, new features |
